DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS- FINAL SEMESTER PROJECT
TITLE: "Creating a Data Buffer System with Hash Addressing and Max-Heap Priority Queues"

PROJECT DATA STRUCTURE IMPLEMENTED:
THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROJECT WAS TO DETERMINE IF MAX HEAP PRIORITY QUEUES COULD BE USED TO EFFECTIVELY ROUTE, STORE, AND SORT DATA PACKET OBJECTS AS PART OF A LARGER, 
DATA BUFFER-LIKE PROGRAM. ALTHOUGH MUCH PROGRESS WAS MADE ON ALL THREE OF THESE ACCOUNTS, CERTAIN PROPERTIES OF MAX HEAP PRIORITY QUEUES EMERGED DURING THE PROJECT THAT 
COMPLICATED THESE GOALS AND INDICATED POTENTIAL TRADE-OFFS IN THE PROGRAM'S DESIGN. THE ROUTING AND STORAGE OF DATA PACKET OBJECTS USING MAX HEAP PRIORITY QUEUES PROVED 
HIGHLY EFFICIENT WHILE THE SORTING CHARACTERISTICS OF THESE PQ SUBSTRUCTURES LEFT SOMETHING TO BE DESIRED. ALTHOUGH THE PROJECT WAS INITIALLY PLANNED TO INVOLVE HASHING, 
THIS ADDITIONAL LAYER OF COMPLEXITY WAS DETERMINED TO BE UNNECESSARY, AND WAS SUBSEQUENTLY REMOVED FROM THE PROJECT SCOPE. 


EXPLANATION OF THE DATA STRUCTURE:
THIS PROGRAM IS A HYBRID DATA STRUCTURE CONTAINING FIVE MAX HEAP PRIORITY QUEUES, INSTANTIATED WITHIN AND CONTROLLED BY A "HASHMAP" PARENT DATA STRUCTURE. THE HASHMAP 
PARENT DATA STRUCTURE CONTAINS A MAP-TYPE DATA CONTAINER CALLED "TABLE", THAT HOLDS INTEGER KEYS CORRESPONDING TO MAXHEAP SHARED POINTER VALUES, IN ADDITION TO SEVERAL DATA 
MEMBERS AND FUNCTIONS THAT ARE CLASSIFIED INTO TWO DISTICT GROUPS: "ROUTING AND STORAGE" AND "INDEXING AND REMOVAL". 

THE UNDERLYING PRIORITY QUEUES ARE OCCASIONALLY REFERRED TO AS "DOMAINS" THROUGHOUT THE ASSIGNMENT, THE KEYS THAT THEY ARE INDEXED BY ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF THESE DOMAINS 
AND ARE USED TO ROUTE DATAPACKETS TO THEIR ASSIGNED PRIORITY QUEUE. DATA PACKET OBJECTS ARE THE SMALLEST OBJECTS IN THE PROGRAM AND ARE FREQUENTLY REFERED TO AND TREATED
AS NODES THROUGHOUT THE PROGRAM. PERCOLATE UP AND PERCOLATE DOWN PRIORITY QUEUE ALGORITHMS ARE IMPLEMENTED THROUGHOUT THE ASSIGNMENT TO ORGANIZE THE UNDERLYING MAXHEAP 
PRIORITY QUEUES. 


INSTRUCTIONS TO COMPILE AND RUN THE PROGRAM:
1.) CLONE THE REPOSITORY FROM GITHUB
2.) NAVIGATE TO THE BUILD FOLDER IN THE TERMINAL'S COMMAND LINE
3.) RUN CMAKE COMMANDS TO CREATE THE EXECUTABLE FILES
4.) RUN THE MAKE COMMAND TO COMPILE THE PROJECT
5.) CLEAR THE SCREEN AND ENTER: "./run_app" TO RUN THE MAIN.CPP FILE

THE SCRIPT IN THE MAIN.CPP FILE WILL EXECUTE THE COMMANDS FOR THE PROJECT. YOU MAY FOLLOW ALONG BY READING THE MAIN.CPP FILE AND READING THE TERMINAL PRINT STATEMENTS. 
THIS PROGRAM REPOSITORY CONTAINS TWO CPP FILES AND TWO HEADER FILES, ALL KEPT IN THE "code" FOLDER. DATAPACKET OBJECTS AND MEMBER FUNCTIONS ARE KEPT IN "DataPacket.h" AND 
"DataPacket.cpp", WHILE THE MAXHEAPPQ AND HASHMAP DECLARATIONS AND DEFINITIONS ARE KEPT IN "MaxHeapHashMap.h" AND "MaxHeapHashMap.cpp" FILES RESPECTIVELY. 


PLEASE ENJOY THE PROJECT.
THANK YOU.
